# Data Science & Analytics Project

## Genre Prediction 

## How the Applications Work

Buat create_data.py jalaninnya pake genre kayak create_data.py [genre] genrenya bebas tergantung folder
create_model.py langsung bisa
test_model.py [lokasi video yang mau di test (jangan pake spasi di namanya)]

-----------------------------

The application is console-based which can be executed from the terminal. The general steps are as follows:

1. The program will import the data from the .csv that provided. 
2. Null values that imported will be filled by mean (numeric) and mode (categorical)
3. The outlier of the data will be removed also. 

More detailed information can be found on the program source code or by clicking [here](https://medium.com/mlreview/gradient-boosting-from-scratch-1e317ae4587d).

Main Focus:
* Predict diabetic by using numerical data.
* Classify diabetic by using categorical data. 

## Getting Started (How to Run the Program)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites (How to set up your machine)

1. Navigate to the directory where is the root of this project folder.
2. Still in the directory where is the root of this project, install all its dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Dependencies are all listed in `requirements.txt`. To re-generate
    this file (after you've installed new packages), simply you can
    it directly on the file. If you have a problem installing the dependencies, 
    please install java system package first.

3. Run the app

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
4. The app is now running!
